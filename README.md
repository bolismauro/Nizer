# Nizer

Nizer is a sample application that I'm using to test the [GPUImage framework](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) and some features of iOS 7.

It uses a real time video processing to show a preview. To save an image in the gallery, just tap the screen.

Currently tested only with an iPad 3.
